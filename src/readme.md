Hello resonate,

I am very appreciative that you have shortlisted me to take this technical test and would love to inform you that I will not disappoint. I made this in very little time so it's not perfect.  For example there is a hyperlink for all the names in the contact section. I want to change it so that only one of the table rows has the hyperlink and the others don't but that would mess with my ngFor. The second thing I struggled with was passing data from one component to another using services. I wanted to send the contact information from contact-page to contact-view and have it so different values would appear based on those values but whilst it sounds simple this is very difficult in angular considering time constraints. If there were no time constraint I would actually sit it through and figure it out which is actually what I'm going to do after I send this email.
